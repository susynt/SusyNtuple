2014-01-17 Steve
	* Changed default value of susyFinalState to 0 to be consistent with SUSYTools
	* Changed order of Hdecay enum in WhTruthExtractor. kUnknown is now 0 to be
	  consistent with susyFinalState and SUSYTools.
	* Added empty MCWeighter class definition which will handle the MC normalization
		* At the moment it only holds the sys enum
	* Added cross section systematic to getEventWeight methods

2014-01-16 Anyes

		* buildSumwMap method will now find all process cutflow hists
		  in the input files and fill the map accordingly
	* getEventWeight now has new argument for controlling the sumw feature: useProcSumw
		* Setting this to true for all bkg MC and data shouldn't have any effect
		* It should only be set to false for samples that have multiple 
		  processes and you DON'T want to normalize each process separately.
		* NOTE: I changed the order of the arguments!
			* Luckily, the other affected arg is new and 
			  probably nobody is using it yet anyway.

		* I'm not totally sure of this... Need to consider all of the use cases.

		* Lepton has variables unnecessary for taus, so we may want to move things around later.
		* I will keep everything backwards compatible for now and not change the Lepton class

	  the lumi, pileup, xsec combined weight

	* Moved getDiLepEvtType(Leptons) to SusyDefs so can be used outside trigger class
	* Note: If you want to inherit methods from Susy2LepCutflow, maybe need to

	  the future.
	* The above has been fixed. You can now inherit from CF. If you don't specify event
	  type it will just save everything under unknown and code shouldn't crash.
